    <article class="first">
      <p>The worms cutter lady and other stories<span class="price">&#163;10.99</span>
        <small>It’s an Italy imbued with superstition and religion, traditions and feelings,
          the one portrayed in the seven stories of the collection. A boy soprano,
          the fascists and Masciàre cat witches. A woman who makes fun of the priest and much more.
          Life in the narrow streets of the Old Town of Bari,
          with hanging clothes and fresh pasta orecchiette, votive kiosks and the smell of coffee. Get ready to enter a
          world of times gone by,
          to breathe the "perfume" and to rejoice, fear, love with the characters of these stories.

    <article class="second">
      <p>After the funeral: November 1975<span class="price">&#163;12.99</span>
        <small>1975, Bari. Luigi has just returned from Rome to spend some time in the family
          and rejoice in the life of the neighbourhood and old friends who know little about
          the plots and attacks on the Republic that take place in the capital.
          Between power lobbies and diverted intelligence, in his graduation thesis,
          Luigi follows the same investigations on oil companies that Pier Paolo Pasolini
          started before being killed. The violent murder of the writer brings him home.

    <article class="third">
      <p>The last accursed poet<span class="price">&#163;10.99</span>
        <small>A box containing the letters that Icarus wrote to his beloved on the
          beaches of Brighton and the fragments of blue majolica from an ancient Egyptian
          amulet is the focus of this novel. The last accursed poet tells the life of the
          Poets of Wax, misunderstood geniuses, foolhardy fools able to see beyond materiality.
          Tireless travellers who, living with passion and dreams, leave an indelible mark
          on people and are able to change the world.</small></p>
